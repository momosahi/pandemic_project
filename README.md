# pandemic_project
Simulation of a pandemic using java, javafx and SIR model



To run this application, you need :
    If you use an IDE :
        - Unzip the archive
        - create a folder named pandemic and move all the files of the archive into it
        - run the Main

    If you don't have an IDE :
        - Unzip the archive
        - create a folder named pandemic and move all the files in the archive into it
        - Go to this file and compile with the command : javac Main.java, then execute with : java Main


NB 1 : When I execute the program, there is a nullPointerException which is raised and I did not succeed in correcting it.
NB 2 : I was inspired by one of the codes I had to evaluate during the code review
NB 3: I assumed that no vaccine had been found for the disease in our simulation and that it could be cured
       after INFECTION_DURATION.
